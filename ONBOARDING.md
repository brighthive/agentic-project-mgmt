# BrightHive — New Engineering Leader Onboarding

> **Status (PR #1 / Phase 1 MVP)**: Layer 1 atomic primitives only. The full `make onboard` ceremony and `make localstack`/`make stagingstack` wrappers land in subsequent PRs. This document covers what works today.

This repo is the **agentic project management hub**. It also holds the onboarding bootstrap that pulls all BrightHive secrets to your laptop and materializes per-repo `.env` files so you can run the platform locally.

## What you need before starting

| Item | Where to get it |
|---|---|
| AWS SSO profiles configured | `aws configure sso` for each: `brighthive-main`, `brighthive-staging`, `brighthive-production` (see `~/.aws/config`). Ask your manager for the SSO start URL if you don't have it. |
| LastPass account on the BrightHive vault | `brew install lastpass-cli` (macOS), then `lpass login you@brighthive.io` |
| GitHub access to the `brighthive` org | SSH key added to your GitHub account, org membership confirmed |
| `python3` (3.11+) | `brew install python@3.13` |
| `aws` CLI | `brew install awscli` |
| `gh` CLI (optional, used in later PRs) | `brew install gh` |

## Step 1 — Clone this repo and fill in your `.env`

```bash
git clone git@github.com:brighthive/agentic-project-mgmt.git
cd agentic-project-mgmt

cp .env.example .env
$EDITOR .env   # fill in your AWS profile names, LastPass user, GitHub token
```

## Step 1b — Unpack the vault package (new leaders only, one-time)

> **If you already have your `{name}lead/` directory from a previous setup, skip this step.**

The `{name}lead/` directory (e.g. `mattlead/`, `kurilead/`) holds your raw vault export files — AWS Secrets Manager, LastPass, DynamoDB workspace configs. It is **gitignored** and never committed. For a brand-new engineering leader, the TechLead packages it for you.

**TechLead: generate a handoff package for the new leader** (e.g. for "matt"):
```bash
make onboard NAME=matt
# → produces mattlead-export.zip.enc
# Share the file + password securely via 1Password/LastPass secure note
```

**New leader: unpack it on your machine:**
```bash
# Copy mattlead-export.zip.enc into the repo root, then:
NAME=matt make unpack
# Prompts for decryption password → creates mattlead/ directory
```

**Verify it's complete:**
```bash
NAME=matt make verify-lead
```

After unpacking, `mattlead/` contains all the JSON vault exports that power `make pull-secrets NAME=matt`. Once you have AWS SSO access provisioned, you can refresh your own vault with `FORCE=1 make pull-aws-secrets NAME=matt` — but for day-1 you don't need AWS access.

> **Every `make pull-*` and `make env-*` command accepts `NAME=<your-name>`.** Your `{name}lead/` is your personal vault cache — no two engineers share a directory.

## Step 2 — Verify your credentials

```bash
make check-creds
```

You should see green ticks for `brighthive-main`, `brighthive-staging`, `brighthive-production`, and your LastPass session. Any red ✗ tells you exactly what to fix:

```bash
make refresh-aws        # runs `aws sso login --profile X` for each expired session
make refresh-lastpass   # runs `lpass login $LASTPASS_USER` if needed
```

`make check-creds` is **idempotent** — re-running it when everything is already valid completes in <2 seconds with all ticks.

## Step 3 — Pull cached vault secrets

```bash
make pull-secrets
```

This pulls AWS Secrets Manager values (main / staging / production) and the BrightHive LastPass vault into a local `./secrets/` directory (gitignored, never committed). It honors a 24-hour cache — re-running within that window skips with "cache fresh". Override with `FORCE=1`:

```bash
FORCE=1 make pull-secrets
```

## Step 4 — Materialize `brightbot/.env`

```bash
make env-brightbot-local
```

This reads `config/env-templates/brightbot-local.env.tmpl`, resolves every `{{ source.key }}` token against the cached vault data, and writes `../brightbot/.env`. It records a SHA-based audit trail in `.state/env/brightbot-local.meta` so subsequent runs can detect:

- **Nothing changed** → skip silently
- **You edited the file** → print diff and refuse to overwrite (use `FORCE=1` to overwrite)
- **An unmanaged `.env` was already there** → refuse to overwrite (use `ADOPT=1` to take ownership without changing the file, or `FORCE=1` to overwrite)

If the renderer encounters any unresolved `{{ source.key }}` token, it exits non-zero and lists which keys are missing — there is no silent empty substitution.

## Step 4b — Materialize `brighthive-webapp/.env.local`

```bash
make env-webapp-local
```

This writes `../brighthive-webapp/.env.local` with the local GraphQL / BrightAgent endpoints plus the staging-backed API keys the webapp still needs locally (`STREAM_KEY`, LangGraph API key, etc.). It intentionally leaves `VITE_TOKEN_USER` blank — running `make local` inside `../brighthive-webapp` will generate a fresh local JWT and inject it for you.

## Step 5 — Verify brightbot accepts the env

```bash
cd ../brightbot
python scripts/local_bootstrap.py
```

If brightbot starts without missing-env errors, the onboarding bootstrap worked.

## Step 6 — Check your overall state

```bash
make status
```

Shows you the age of every sentinel — AWS sessions, LastPass session, each secrets-cache pull, each materialized `.env`. Tells you at a glance what's stale.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `make check-aws` reports `session expired` | `make refresh-aws` — opens browser for SSO |
| `make pull-aws-secrets` prints "AccessDenied" | Your IAM role doesn't have `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` on that account; talk to ops |
| `make env-brightbot-local` exits 1 with "unresolved tokens" | A LastPass entry or AWS secret is missing/renamed; either fix the template or fix the vault |
| `make env-brightbot-local` exits 3 with "Unmanaged file present" | Existing `.env` wasn't created by the bootstrap. Run `ADOPT=1 make env-brightbot-local` to take ownership (no overwrite) or `FORCE=1 make env-brightbot-local` to replace it. |
| Renderer complains about a missing template path | Run from the repo root (`cd agentic-project-mgmt`) — paths are relative to it |
