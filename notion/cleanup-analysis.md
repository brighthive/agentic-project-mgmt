## Proposed Cleanup Process

1. **Create Archive section** in Notion
2. **Delete abandoned "Untitled" pages** from 2024
3. **Move 2025 untitled pages** to Archive
4. **Review named pages** with team for relevance
5. **Update Workspace Index** to reflect clean structure
6. **Document retained pages** in local `pages.md`

## Impact

- **Before**: ~100+ pages, mostly untitled/abandoned
- **After**: ~15-20 core active pages
- **Improvement**: 80-85% reduction in clutter
