# Longaeva — Trial Scorecard

14-day POC. Start date: **2026-06-15** (Trial Day 1, 6 days out). Days are relative to the agreed start. Updated daily once trial begins.

> **2026-06-11 cycle-18 — SV lifecycle + QC live on staging; MCP reaches the agent, not yet Snowflake.** Shipped the semantic-view *lifecycle* (lineage, ship-to-PR, QC) to staging and stood up a live MCP integration harness. Honest headline: **MCP → BrightAgent is live and verified; BrightAgent → Snowflake *via MCP* is NOT yet working** — a `deep_agent` routing gap, handed to Marwan. No green-washing; the harness proves it by failing on it.
>
> **Shipped to staging (all 4 repos at develop=staging parity):**
> - **BH-619** SV lineage — `base_tables` + join graph on `list_semantic_views` ([bb#532](https://github.com/brighthive/brightbot/pull/532)→[#533](https://github.com/brighthive/brightbot/pull/533)). Live-verified: 4 base tables + 3 joins.
> - **BH-620** ship SV YAML as a governed PR — scaffold→upsert→`commitSemanticViewToGitHub` ([bb#536](https://github.com/brighthive/brightbot/pull/536)→[#537](https://github.com/brighthive/brightbot/pull/537)). 11 contract tests, write-safety reviewed (idempotent branch, partial-write honesty).
> - **BH-622** SV QC — read-only upstream-vs-product (row counts, null rates, freshness, flags) ([bb#538](https://github.com/brighthive/brightbot/pull/538)→[#539](https://github.com/brighthive/brightbot/pull/539)). Live vs `LONGAEVA_POC`: 174,384-row mart vs 3 REF upstreams; surfaced a real `IDENTIFIER_MAP.EFFECTIVE_TO` 100%-null flag.
> - **BH-601** live MCP-driven Golden Cases + Longaeva PoC E2E harness ([bb#540](https://github.com/brighthive/brightbot/pull/540)→[#541](https://github.com/brighthive/brightbot/pull/541)) — the repeatable acceptance gate.
>
> **MCP end-to-end — proven vs blocked:**
> - ✅ MCP server live (`mcp.staging.brighthive.net/mcp`); OAuth gate fixed (`BH_MCP_*` env → staging Cognito issuer); auth→agent→Bedrock inference verified live.
> - ✅ OneTen staging workspace now → Snowflake `LONGAEVA_POC` (replaced its Synapse+2×Redshift; backup retained).
> - 🔴 `deep_agent` answers warehouse questions from `search_memory_tool`/`read_file` instead of delegating to the dbt subagent's `introspect_warehouse_schema`/`qc_semantic_view_pipeline`; when forced, errors `Missing user_id or token in session_info` (MCP→subagent handoff drops session_info). **Handed to Marwan.** Harness Q1/Q2/Q4 correctly FAIL on this by design.
>
> **6 analyst questions:** Q1 SV-list, Q2 lineage, Q3 ship-PR, Q4 QC — **all built**, *gated on the deep_agent routing fix for MCP reachability*. Q5 alerting ❌ not built. Q6 RBAC ⚠️ read-half only.
>
> **Jira:** BH-619/620/622 → Staging QC. **Notion** "2 · Current Status" + **TRACKER.md** synced. **#engineering:** Matt (Claude connect-guide) + Marwan (routing finding) posted 2026-06-10.

> **EOD 2026-06-09 cycle-17 — final tally, 20 PRs across 4 repos**. Cycles 8-17 added a CI workflow gating 70 unit tests (`pc#805`), a `make verify-pristine` one-command pre-flight (`pc#804`), folder + scripts READMEs and CONTRIBUTING guides, a Unit-Tests CI badge, and an expanded runbook glossary keying every `errorCode` to a recovery path. **Net change since cycle-7**: GC-6 platform layer was already end-to-end then; cycles 8-17 made it discoverable, gated, and testable cold by anyone with a laptop. Cycles 13-17 were explicitly marked **FILLER** in PR descriptions per user election. Eng channel updated 2026-06-09 (`#engineering` ts `1781011761.012769`). Final PR list captured under `BRIGHTHIVE_GAPS.md` `amended[]`.

> **EOD 2026-06-08 cycle-7 — GC-6 demo loop fulfills its purpose end-to-end**. After the merge train captured below, an autonomous loop shipped 8 more PRs across 4 repos closing the platform-side of GC-6 from "specced" to "live PR opens against `github.com/brighthive/longaeva-semantic-views` in 30 seconds." Composite ≥10-of-14 GCs demoed convincingly: ~70% (held — no GC moved, but GC-6 went from `[~] needs work` to `✅ end-to-end on local`). Detail:
>
> - **pc#797** — auth role hierarchy (BH-612), full OGM seed (7 unseeded types, 42 nodes), 109-mutation inventory, 14-of-23 Longaeva delta verified live
> - **pc#798** — SPEC-SEMANTIC-VIEW-AUTHORING-E2E (open, draft) — 10 invariants + 11 Gherkin scenarios + 4 properties; defines the trial-uses-our-GitHub-not-customer-GHE model
> - **pc#799** — `WorkspaceGitHubBindingNode` + `setWorkspaceGitHubBinding` + `getWorkspaceGitHubBinding` (BH-613). PAT in Secrets Manager only, never echoed
> - **pc#800** — `commitSemanticViewToGitHub` orchestrator (BH-614). 9-step pipeline, idempotent retry, every step surfaces verbatim `errorCode` + `httpStatus`. Verified against real `github.com/brighthive/longaeva-semantic-views`
> - **pc#801** — 20 deterministic eval tests for the orchestrator (BH-618) — Properties 1–4 + 5 eval rows
> - **pc#802** — LocalStack in `docker-compose.local.yml` + endpoint-aware AWS clients (BH-611). Local stack now round-trips Secrets Manager calls without LocalStack-Pro / SSO
> - **pc#803** — token-redaction regex extension (audit-debt #11). `ghu_*`, `ghr_*`, `?access_token=`, `&pat=` — closed leak surfaces on X-1 invariant. 20 regression tests
> - **bb#520** — GHE proxy selection-set drift (audit-debt #10). All 7 mutations now select `errorCode` + `httpStatus`; revives the dormant BRANCH_EXISTS retry path. 7 regression tests
> - **brighthive-scripts#3** — `provision_semantic_views_repo.sh` (BH-617) — one-command per-customer onboarding
> - **brighthive-scripts#4** — `trial_day_1_dry_run.sh` — re-runnable 5-step demo smoke against any environment + JWT, with cleanup. Verified happy + auto-merge + bad-JWT paths
> - **agentic-project-mgmt#30** — [`OPERATOR-RUNBOOK-DAY-1.md`](./OPERATOR-RUNBOOK-DAY-1.md) — pre-flight checklist + 4-mutation live demo script + 7 named recovery paths keyed on errorCode values
>
> **Trial-Day-1 platform readiness**: ✅ green. Anyone with `PC_GRAPHQL_URL` + admin JWT + workspace/asset UUIDs can run `scripts/trial_day_1_dry_run.sh` and a real GitHub PR opens. Property 1 (PAT redaction) and Property 2 (yamlHash continuity) hold under test.
>
> **Outstanding for Day 1 (humans only, not session-reachable)**: staging deploy of pc#797–803 + bb#520 (auto-flips GC-10 S6/S7 + the GC-6 demo path); BH-533 connectivity validation post-deploy; demo storyboard scope decision with Grant; LONGAEVA_AGENT_ROLE runtime in CDK.
>
> **Sprint-sized deferrals** (untouched this cycle, intentionally): #6 bb#489 multi-table semantic view, #7 generate_mart_model (GC-5), #8 Snowflake auto-trigger (~50 lines pc + SSM), BH-615 + BH-616 (webapp UI — paused per "no UI mess" instruction).
>
> Full pre-cron handoff: [`SESSION-HANDOFF-2026-06-08.md`](./SESSION-HANDOFF-2026-06-08.md).

> **EOD 2026-06-08 — Pre-trial code locked in develop** (pre-cron baseline). 24 PRs squash-merged across brightbot / pc / webapp / cdk over the weekend (bb#510, 511, 512, 513, 514, 515, 516, 517, 518, 491, 484, 501, 498; pc#793, 794, 795, 796, 779, 769, 785; wa#1132, 1133, 1102, 1123, 1124; cdk#156). 6 specs signed off in develop (SPEC-GOLDEN-CASES, SPEC-SNOWFLAKE-E2E, SPEC-GENERATE-MART-MODEL, SPEC-BB-OKTA-FEDERATED, SPEC-GHE-MIGRATION-FINAL, SPEC-MCP-DCR-RFC7591) — every code PR has a contract pointer; §10 questions resolved on all 4 spec docs that had them. Live verdict on develop HEAD: GC harness 5 passed / 8 skipped / 2 strict-xfailed in 21s; L3 full-graph e2e 1 passed in 59s; semantic-view query alive ($174B exposure across 196 issuers via `SEMANTIC_VIEW(... METRICS exposure.total_exposure_usd DIMENSIONS exposure.asset_class_code)`); 14 distinct live-Snowflake function-tier verifications green. Composite ≥10-of-14 GCs demoed convincingly: **40% → ~70%**. **Outstanding for Day 1**: staging deploy (auto-flips GC-10 S6/S7), BH-533 connectivity validation, demo storyboard scope decision with Grant (single-table vs schema-wide GC-6 framing). Full handoff: [`SESSION-HANDOFF-2026-06-08.md`](./SESSION-HANDOFF-2026-06-08.md).

> **EOD 2026-06-01**: Snowflake integration shipped end-to-end across 4 PRs (brightbot [#488](https://github.com/brighthive/brightbot/pull/488) + [#489](https://github.com/brighthive/brightbot/pull/489), platform-core [#777](https://github.com/brighthive/brighthive-platform-core/pull/777), data-organization-cdk [#156](https://github.com/brighthive/brighthive-data-organization-cdk/pull/156)). 168 unit tests green. All 7 layers of the warehouse-agnostic pattern Snowflake-compliant. Trial unblocked for §1 ingestion + §2 semantic-view enrollment.
>
> **EOD 2026-06-03**: Self-hosting deployment simplified. Per Matt's 11:29 ET email to Grant/Sumukh, BrightHive committed to ship a **Terraform module as the primary deployment path** for Longaeva (CDK remains as alternative). Trial-guide artifact extended with Path A (Terraform, recommended) + Path B (CDK), plus a uv-based local install section (`uv tool install brighthive` recommended; pip fallback documented). Simplified setup doc + Terraform module due to Longaeva by EOW 2026-06-05. New tickets **BH-584** (TF module — Ahmed), **BH-585** (setup doc — Kuri), **BH-586** (CLI/uv publish — Marwan) created under BH-526. MCP auth-workflow conversation to be held with Grant + Sumukh before Grant's vacation.
>
> **Honest engineering reality (2026-06-03)**: the FS-critical foundation is **open PRs in review, NOT merged** — Snowflake (`brightbot#488`), GHE proxy (`platform-core#778` + `brightbot#490`), P0 security chain (BH-559→565, drafts), Atlas scaffolder (`brightbot#489`, draft). Merged to `develop` so far: MCP server *scaffold* (`brightbot#497` — `invoke_analyst` still a stub), data profiler (`#485/#487`), BrightSignals notif (`#486`). Nothing is deployed to staging/prod. The PoC sandbox (11/11 use cases vs live Snowflake) de-risks the design; it is not the product running.
